# About
This file contains angular velocity readings for two step functions.<br>
Both step functions were executed with 50% reaction wheel duty cycle. 50% was choosen because on 50% duty cycle and above our angular velocity sensor is going into saturation.

## Files
- `fit_step_response.m` contains a function which will, based on a provided data points, fit a exponential function
- `import_csv_data_and_fit.m` contains code which will import data from csv file and try to fit the data to known exponential function. Also, in this file there are comments about PID regulator coeffitients which were created by running Matlab PID Tuner app. Unfortunately, PID Tuner app does not provide creating scripts which would automatically optimize PID parameters. Every time when user wants to get PID parameters, one must import transfer function which was generated by this script.
- `step_response.csv` file contains gyro measurements which were sampled with 100 ms period. Values are in mili radians per second. Two step responses were generated with both 50% pwm duty cycle on the torque wheel.
